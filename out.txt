%  If you choose yes, the following fields must be specified:
%  'datablank','skip_datablank','substitue_blank'

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: gain_calibrate
%  Would you like to adjust data to a gain calibration?
%  Choose one of the following, input as a number:

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: use_rep
%  Which reference excitation profile would you like to use?
%  Choose one of the following, input as a string:
%     cal = from a calibration
%     ex  = from the "ex" data column recorded in the file at the time of
%           measurement
%  If you choose cal, the following fields must be specified:
%  'led_calpath'. 
%  Also, the appropriate calibration factors provided by Satlantic for each
%  LED must be provided in the fields 'blue_calfactor','green_calfactor', or
%  'fop_calfactor'

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: blue_calfactor
%        green_calfactor
%        fop_calfactor
%  Calibration factors for each LED as provided by Satlantic. Input as a
%  number in units of umol photons m-2 s-1. Must be specified if field
%  var_return is set to "all" or "fit"

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: sig_rel
%  Would you like to fit a relative rather than absolute sigma?
%  Choose one of the following, input as a number:
%     yes = 1
%     no  = 0

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: first_time_point
%  First time point included in the fit of single turnover induction. This
%  allows the user to skip points that may be inconsistent due to the
%  reference excitation profile (Barnett et al. in prep.). Input as a
%  number in units of us. For example, if you wanted to skip the first 4 us
%  of the sti flash, then first_time_point=5. If you want to use all time
%  points, then first_time_point=1. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: gain_calpath
%  Full path to the appropriate gain calibration. Input as a string. Be
%  sure to include '/' as the last character. Must be specified if field
%  'gain_calibrate' is set to 1.

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: led_calpath
%  Full path to the appropriate led calibration. Input as a string. Be sure
%  to include '/' as the last character. Must be specified if field use_rep
%  is set to 'cal'. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: datapath
%  Full path to the data location. Input as a string. Be sure to include 
%  '/' as the last character. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: maketextfile
%  Would you like to save data output as a tab-deliniated text file?
%  Choose one of the following, input as a number:
%     yes = 1
%     no  = 0
%  For data output, file will be named: outname_data, for fit output, file
%  will be named: outname_sti_fit. The text file will be stored in
%  datapath. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: outname
%  Desired name of output *.mat and *.txt files, input as a string.
%  DO NOT include the *.txt or *.mat in the outname, the program will
%  insert that itself. Note that outnames can not start with a number. For
%  example: outname='1015TP' is not acceptable, where outname='TP1015' is. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: datadate
%  Date of sample measurement as a string. Can either be in the format
%  'YYYYMMDD' or 'MthDDYY'. For example, May 26th, 2007 would be either
%  '20070526' or 'May0507'. The reason for having this field is to make
%  sure that the date recorded in the FIRe data files matches reality. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: datafile
%  Batch name of the data file as a text string. Program assumes
%  all files increase sequentially from datafile.000 (Except see
%  field: skip_datafile).

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: skip_datafile
%  Vector of file numbers to be skipped. For example, if you wish to skip
%  files *.006, *.040, and *.856, then skip_datafile=[6 40 856]. Note this 
%  literally skips the file, no placeholder column is generated. If skipfile
%  is empty, the default is to process all files sequentially from 
%  datafile.000.
%  Note: Recall that the program assumes all files with name 'datafile'
%  start at datafile.000 increse sequentially in increments of 1. Thus, 
%  if a filenumber is missing from the data file sequence THE PROGRAM
%  WILL ASSUME IT HAS PROCESSED ALL DATA FILES. For example, if
%  datafile.010 does not exist, but datafile.011 does, the program will
%  only process files *.000 to *.009. If you specify skip_datafile=[10],
%  then the program will process files *.000 to *.009 and *.011 and up. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: datablank, skip_datablank
%  Batch name of the blank file as a text string, and vector of file numbers
%  to be skipped, as for datafile and skip_datafile. Must be specified if
%  blank_subtract is set to 1.

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: substitute_blank
%  The blanking program assumes a blank is measured at each gain setting 
%  used during sample measurement. If a blank is missing for a gain
%  setting, the blanking program will return NaNs OR a gain calibration can
%  be applied to all other blank measurements and substituted for the
%  missing value. 
%  Choose one of the following, input as a number:
%     yes = 1
%     no  = 0
%  If yes, field gain_calpath must be specified.

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: dyecon
%  Concentration of the fluorescent dye used to generate relative
%  fluorescence units. Can have any units. Return data will have the same
%  units. Must be specified if calc_rfu is set to 1.

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: dyefile, skip_dyefile
%  Batch name of the dye file as a text string, and vector of file numbers
%  to be skipped, as for datafile and skip_datafile. Must be specified if
%  calc_rfu is set to 1.

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: dyeblank, skip_dyeblank
%  Batch name of the dye blank file as a text string, and vector of file numbers
%  to be skipped, as for datafile and skip_datafile. Must be specified if
%  calc_rfu is set to 1. There is no option to generate relative
%  fluroescence units without a blank. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: doplots
%  Would you like to see a plot of each fit?
%  Choose one of the following, input as a number:
%     yes = 1
%     no  = 0

%__________________________________________________________

%     yes = 1
%     no  = 0

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: sti_model
%  Specified model for curve fit of single turnover induction.
%  Choose one of the following options, input as a text string.
%    sti_fofmsig        = fit fo, fm and sigma
%    sti_fofmsigp       = fit fo, fm, sigma and p
%    sti_fofmsig_pcon   = fit fo, fm, and sigma holding p constant
%    sti_p              = fit p, holding fo, fm and sigma constant
%    sti_fofmsig_pfirst = select files to fit p, then fit all remaining
%                         files holding p at this value
%    sti_fofmsig_plast  = fit for fo, fm and sig, then fit again for p,
%                         holding the first three constant

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: sti_pfiles
%  Vector of file numbers used to calculate connectivity (p). For example,
%  if you wish to use filnumbers *.006 through *.010 to estimate p, then
%  sti_pfiles=[6:10]. Must be specified if sti_model is 
%  'sat_fofmsig_pfirst'. 

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: sti_cv
%  Vector of values for variables held constant during the fit of sti,
%  input as a vector.
%  If sti_model is 'sti_p', set values of [Fo Fm sigma]
%  If sti_model is 'sti_fofmsig_pcon', set value of [p]

%    str_tau2x    = fit Fo, Fm, tau1/alpha1, tau2 (alpha2=1-alpha1)
%    str_tau2xcon = fit tau1/alpha1, tau2 (alpha2=1-alpha1), holding
%                   Fo and Fm constant

%__________________________________________________________
% Field: str_cv
%  Vector of values for variables held constant during the fit of str,
%  input as a vector.
